INTERPRETING STATE OUTPUT:

Here is an example state (the start state for the sensing example).
This corresponds to figure 3 in the paper.

*w1{key(),tails()}
  B(bob) = w3, w4,
  K(bob) = w1, w2, w3, w4,
  B(alice) = w2,
  K(alice) = w1, w2,
w2{key()}
  B(bob) = w3, w4,
  K(bob) = w1, w2, w3, w4,
  B(alice) = w2,
  K(alice) = w1, w2,
w3{tails()}
  B(bob) = w3, w4,
  K(bob) = w1, w2, w3, w4,
  B(alice) = w4,
  K(alice) = w3, w4,

There are four worlds. World "w1" gets a star because it is the designated
world.  Following each world name is the list of fluents that
are true in that world.  Below each world name is a list of relation
edges: two lists for each agent, one for knowledge and one for
belief. For example, on line 21 of this file, we see that there should be dotted
(belief) edges labeled "Bob" ("B" in the figure) leaving the designated world
(upper left corener in figure) and going to worlds 3 (bottom left) and 4 (lower
right).
