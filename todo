improve makefile
in depl, ommited kripke edges are caught with an assertion, but should be an exception
fast check for agent type at depth


NEEDED FOR AIJ PAPER
    fail conditions?
    all agents automatically perform observations after any agent's ontic and announcement actions?
    replanning (policy updates?)?
    !plan for model learning, track models through search tree
    !model updates

move check for right types of agents etc to planner instead of parser:
e.g. should be able to have depls with no system agent just for testing actions

stop early if cycles?

add a new abstract class for NonPassiveAgents?

redo test: getworlds only gives form worlds?

beliefRelation and KnowledgeRelation subtypes, just for type safety in kripkeStructure constructor

try to execute an action without preconditions satisfied, e.g. using test system: not caught except that there is no designated world...

observesif uses undefined type in expansion, catch error

can't expand on 'object' type?

iterated dfs: iterate cost instead of # actions?

hashCode and equals functions for actions, so we don't have to search through action names or whatever?

heurisitics to speed search
heuristics to stop before goal, time limits?
common knowledge
probability
