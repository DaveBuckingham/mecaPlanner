OPTIMIZATIONS
    fast check for agent type at depth


NEEDED FOR AIJ PAPER
    fail conditions?
    all agents automatically perform observations after any agent's ontic and announcement actions?
    replanning (policy updates?)?
    !plan for model learning, track models through search tree
    !model updates

DONE FOR AIJ
    arbitrary agent turn order (recode search algo)
    read config files
    time formulae for goals
    conditional effects ('hiding')
    constants, constant removal
    observesif (and causesif, and what else?) should check constants as well as fluents
    handle mulitple observes and observesif rules per agent, probably or them together

remove static id counter from Solution

stop early if cycles

move Initialize into parser directory

add a new abstract class for NonPassiveAgents

redo test: getworlds only gives form worlds.

beliefRelation and KnowledgeRelation subtypes, just for type safety in kripkeStructure constructor

try to execute an action without preconditions satisfied, e.g. using test system: not caught except that there is no designated world...

if an initially statement has unmatched parens, e.g. 'C(inKitchen(bob)', this isn't caught by parser and gives funky initial state

improve makefile, still finnicky

when printing policy, give agent names instead of just agent number

currently i don't think we check that the "owner" field of actions is sensible

observesif uses undefined type in expansion, catch error

can't expand on 'object' type

predicates as action parameters, variables?

iterated dfs: iterate cost instead of # actions?



heurisitics to speed search
heuristics to stop before goal, time limits?
common knowledge
real fluents
probability
